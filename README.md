Project Summary: PGA Tour Player Analysis

In this project, I worked with a PGA Tour database that provided basic statistics for various players. However, the database did not include all players on the PGA Tour. To address this limitation, I focused on the top 50 players available in the database and extracted 9 key data points for each player.

The main objectives of the project were as follows:

Data Collection: 
- Obtained a PGA Tour database with basic statistics for multiple players.

Data Parsing: 
- Identified the top 50 players from the available data and extracted 9 relevant data points for each of them.

Graphical Analysis: 
- Utilized the matplotlib library in Python to create four informative graphs from the extracted data:

Driving Distances: 
- Developed a graph showing the driving distances of each player ranked from greatest to smallest, enabling a quick comparison of players' driving abilities.

Strokes Gained Putting: 
- Constructed a graph displaying the strokes gained putting of each player ranked from least to greatest, highlighting their putting performance.

Leading Driver Brands: 
- Created a pie chart representing the distribution of driver brands among the top 50 players, offering insights into the preferred equipment choices of these players.

Leading Putters: 
- Generated another pie chart illustrating the distribution of putter brands among the top 50 players, showcasing the popular choices for putters.

The project consisted of three Python files:

readata.py: This file printed out each player's name and the 9 data points associated with them from the PGA Tour database.

readatapie.py: Utilizing matplotlib, this file generated the two pie graphs for driver brands and putter brands, respectively.

readatabar.py: Also leveraging matplotlib, this file created the two bar graphs for driving distances and strokes gained putting.

Overall, the project provided valuable insights into the top 50 PGA Tour players' performance, equipment preferences, and crucial statistics that could be of interest to golf enthusiasts and analysts alike.
